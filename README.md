# A* Algorithm
## What is This
First of all its just a Fun litle Project.
A Java Project With GUI, to demonstrate the A* algorithm.
This Program will/shall help understanding the A*.
Furthermore it demonstrates the process of the A* Pathfinding algorithm and visualis every step of th process.

## The GUI
The GUI shall help explore the process of pathinding, step by step, without having to code.
It's possible to:
* Choosing a frid size
* Edit what should be shown (PATH/CALCULATED/CHECKED/distances)
* Adding obstacles like Walls
* seeing the A* step by step
* Setting the Start and Endpoint
* Having a live interactive sandbox autoupdate

## What is A*
A algorithm which finds the shortest path between two given points e.g. ROOT (start),
TARGET (stop), without testing every single possibilitys of Paths.
